About
-----


bebop is a WebExtensions that offers command line interface like
[emacs helm](https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm) for browsing.


Usage
-----

## command

1. `Click icon on toolbar` or `Ctrl+Comma` ... show popup that has command input
2. Input a query to narrow down the candidates.

    NOTE: On Windows, you need to press a tab-key to focus to a query input

| type        | shorthand | description                     |
|:------------|:---------:|:------------------------------- |
| search      |           | open new tab with google search |
| link        | l         | click a link in current page    |
| tab         | t         | active selected tab             |
| history     | h         | open a history                  |
| bookmark    | b         | open a bookmark                 |

- `:type` narrows down to the candidates whose type is the specified type
- `x` also narrows down to the candidates whose shorthand is the specified type
- ex.
  - `阿部寛` narrows down to the all candidates searched with `阿部寛`
  - `:link` or `l` narrow down to link candidates
  - `:link 阿部寛` or `:l 阿部寛` narrow down to link candidates searched with `阿部寛`

3. Select the candidate. You can change the selected candidate with shortcut keys:

| key-binding | command              |
|:------------|:-------------------- |
| tab         | next-candidate       |
| S-tab       | previous-candidate   |
| C-n         | next-candidate       |
| C-p         | previous-candidate   |
| C-j         | next-candidate       |
| C-k         | previous-candidate   |

You can change shortcut key from `Ctrl+Comma`.
See [Customize](#change-shortcut-key-with-your-own-private-addon)

## emacs key-bindings on textarea (except mac)

You can edit with key-bindings in text input of html (not browser native-ui):

| key-binding | command              |
|:------------|:-------------------- |
| C-f         | forward-char         |
| C-b         | backward-char        |
| C-a         | beginning-of-line    |
| C-e         | end-of-line          |
| C-n         | next-line            |
| C-p         | previous-line        |
| M->         | end-of-buffer        |
| M-<         | beginning-of-buffer  |
| C-h         | delete-backward-char |

macOS provides emacs key-bindings for text editing.
So this extension does nothing on macOS.
